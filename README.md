## About this portfolio

This is a living record of what I did in ITAI 4370 and what I took away from it. The course started with the basics of how signals move through a network and ended with me putting machine-learning models inside the network and squeezing them down small enough to run on an edge device. Instead of collecting assignments into a pile, I've tried to organize this around the story of that progression — where I started, what I built, where I got stuck, and what changed in how I think about telecom.

Everything here is my own work from the semester. Every figure came from code I actually ran or from the logged output of a lab, not from placeholder numbers.

## How this repository is organized

| Section | What's inside |
|---|---|
| **[Reflections](reflections/)** | Three reflective essays: how my understanding of telecom evolved, how I applied AI to real telecom problems, and the skills I improved plus where I want to grow next. |
| **[Projects](projects/)** | Full documentation for every practical: problem statement, methods and tools, code, results, and my interpretation. |
| **[Assessments](assessments/)** | The graded artifacts — theory assignments, labs, the ethics assignment, and the case studies I worked through, with the outcome of each. |
| **[Growth evidence](growth/progression.md)** | A module-by-module map of how I moved from basic telecom concepts to advanced AI applications, with concrete before/after evidence. |
| **[assets/](assets/)** | The figures embedded throughout, generated from my own lab runs. |

## Selected works (quick tour)

A few artifacts that best show the range of what I did this semester:

- **RF propagation model** — a Free-Space Path Loss simulation I wrote and plotted from the log-distance equation.
  ![FSPL vs distance](assets/fspl.png)

- **AI-driven 5G slice allocation** — a resource allocator splitting 500 units across URLLC, eMBB, and mMTC slices based on their traffic profiles.
  ![Slice allocation](assets/slicing.png)

- **Network traffic prediction** — a Random Forest that reached a test R² of 0.893, later extended into a full time-series study with ARIMA, Linear Regression, and an LSTM I built from scratch.

- **Edge / model compression** — pruning, INT8 quantization, and knowledge distillation on an IoT classifier, taking a 51 KB model down to under 5 KB.

Diagrams, notes, and reading summaries live inside the [projects](projects/) and [assessments](assessments/) sections.
